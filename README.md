# Fractal Music

Fractal music randomly generated by the computer at run-time.  The user can choose the parameters for generation.

Music is generated based on the [Bohlen-Pierce scale](http://www.ziaspace.com/elaine/BP/Modes_and_Chords.html).

There is a working page at [https://fractalmusic.herokuapp.com](https://fractalmusic.herokuapp.com).
